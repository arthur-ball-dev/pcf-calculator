# Backend API Configuration
# For local development, set this to your backend server (e.g., http://localhost:8000)
# For production (Railway), leave this UNSET or empty - frontend uses same-origin requests
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# MSW Mock Server Configuration
# TASK-FE-P5-006: Switch to Real Backend
#
# By default (VITE_USE_MOCKS not set or set to 'false'), MSW is disabled
# and the frontend connects to the real backend API at VITE_API_BASE_URL.
#
# Set to 'true' ONLY for development without a running backend:
# - Enables Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept API requests
# - Returns mock data instead of real API responses
# - Useful for UI development without backend dependencies
#
# For normal development and testing, keep this set to 'false' or unset
VITE_USE_MOCKS=false
